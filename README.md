This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions by analyzing key behavioral patterns in financial data. It utilizes smart feature selection and data balancing techniques to ensure fairness and accuracy in prediction.

The workflow includes identifying the top 20 influential features, balancing the dataset using SMOTE, and training a reliable model to detect fraud. It outputs performance metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for thorough evaluation.

The final trained model and selected feature list are saved for future use or integration into applications such as web dashboards or automated fraud alert systems. The approach ensures efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability.
